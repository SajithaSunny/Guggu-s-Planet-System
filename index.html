    <h1>The Solar System</h1>

    <h2>The Sun</h2>

    <p>The Sun is a yellow dwarf star, a hot ball of glowing gases at the heart of our solar system. Its gravity holds the solar system together, keeping everything – from the biggest planets to the smallest particles of debris – in its orbit.</p>


    <h2>Mercury</h2>

    <p>Mercury is the smallest planet — it is only slightly larger than Earth's moon. Since it has no significant atmosphere to stop impacts, the planet is pockmarked with craters.</p>


    <h2>Venus</h2>

    <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun, and is Earth's closest neighbor in the solar system. Venus is the brightest object in the sky after the Sun and the Moon, and sometimes looks like a bright star in the morning or evening sky. The planet is a little smaller than Earth, and is similar to Earth inside.</p>


    <h2>Earth</h2>

    <p>Earth, our home, is the third planet from the sun. It's the only planet known to have an atmosphere containing free oxygen, oceans of water on its surface and, of course, life. Earth is the fifth largest of the planets in the solar system. ... About a fifth of Earth's atmosphere consists of oxygen, produced by plants.</p>


    <h2>Mars</h2>
    <img src="https://cmsimages.tribuneindia.com/gallary_content/2020/6/2020_6$largeimg_1813030898.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Mars is sometimes called the Red Planet. It's red because of rusty iron in the ground. Like Earth, Mars has seasons, polar ice caps, volcanoes, canyons, and weather. It has a very thin atmosphere made of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and argon</p>


    <h2>Jupiter</h2>
    <img src="https://astronomy.com/-/media/Images/Magazine%20Articles/2020/08/jupiter12.jpg?mw=600">
    <p>Jupiter is called a gas giant planet. Its atmosphere is made up of mostly hydrogen gas and helium gas, like the sun. The planet is covered in thick red, brown, yellow and white clouds. The clouds make the planet look like it has stripes.</p>


    <h2>Saturn</h2>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/Saturn_during_Equinox.jpg">
    <p>Adorned with thousands of beautiful ringlets, Saturn is unique among the planets. It is not the only planet to have rings—made of chunks of ice and rock—but none are as spectacular or as complicated as Saturn's. Like fellow gas giant Jupiter, Saturn is a massive ball made mostly of hydrogen and helium.</p>
    
    
    <h2>Uranus</h2>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/Uranus2.jpg">
    <p>Uranus was the first planet found using a telescope. Uranus is an Ice Giant planet and nearly four times larger than Earth. Uranus has 27 known moons, most of which are named after literary characters. Like Saturn, Jupiter and Neptune, Uranus is a ringed planet.</p>
    
    <h2>Neptune</h2>
    <img src="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/system/stellar_items/image_files/90_feature_1600x900_4.jpg">
    <p>Neptune is dark, cold, and very windy. ... Neptune is very similar to Uranus. It's made of a thick soup of water, ammonia, and methane over an Earth-sized solid center. Its atmosphere is made of hydrogen, helium, and methane.</p>
